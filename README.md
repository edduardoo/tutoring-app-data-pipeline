# Tutoring App Data Pipeline

This project demonstrates how to build a data pipeline for a tutoring app/website using GCP BigQuery, Pub/Sub, DataFlow, dbt, SQL and Python. 

The mock data is generated in the project itself, using proper probability distributions for each variable along with some arbitrary common-sense premises about the business.
